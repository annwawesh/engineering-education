### What is embedding?
Embedding has various terminologies depending on a context is being used. In plain English, embedding is to implant, attach or insert an object. In computing and in software, embedding is to attach a computer hardware component into a computer software component to execute a highly tailored task. 

In this tutorial, Embedding will be referred to as incorporating videos, images, GIFs, links, or other social media contents like Electronic books (pdf or html files), tweets, Scribd etc. into web pages or any other social media posts. Embedding allows you to lend a video from a different platform into another without to worry about any compatibility issues like dissimilar software versions or formats. 

Video embedding is an action of coding that allows you to borrow and display a video on your website without pulling it from its original source or to host it on your website.

### What are HTML and CSS? 
HTML is an abbreviation for Hypertext Markup Language that is used for structuring a web page like putting headers, titles, creating body etc. CSS is an abbreviation for Cascading Styling Sheets that is utilized for styling a HTML web page. CSS is basically used to make a web page look presentable like putting colors, fonts, spacing etc.

Both HTML and CSS work hand in hand when creating a web page, it does not require one to acquire a lot of skills to know the way around it. Technically, they are both not regarded as a programming language like JavaScript, python, and the rest but it is found in the front-end coding.

### Why use HTML and why not HTML5?
HTML is an older version of HTML5 and can support almost all user‚Äôs browser and unlike HTML5 there can be a lot of hassle in adding multiple sources to support different formats. Additionally, it is easier to embed YouTube videos in HTML by using iframe instead of ``` <video>```  tags in HTML5.

Iframe is an inline frame and permits items to be embedded in one webpage into another webpage and in this case, it is a YouTube page. By using iframe, you do not have to worry about the file format compatibility issues.

#### Side Notes on Embedding Using Iframe and URL
- When embedding videos from any sharing websites, you can either use the video URL, Iframe or Embed the code itself. For this tutorial, we are going to use the Iframe and URL.

 ![step 4](/engineering-education/embedding-a-video-into-a-webpage-using-html-and-css/step-4.jpg)

After clicking on Embed, YouTube will generate a code for you to use, automatically. The iframe tag will have the URL of the video source, width, and height of the video and a few more attributes.

**Step 5:** Click on the copy. 
As shown in the figure below, click on the copy and paste the code in your HTML page(assuming you have the HTML page/code already but if not, do not worry, the steps will be shown afterwards üòä).

 ![step5](/engineering-education/embedding-a-video-into-a-webpage-using-html-and-css/step-5.jpg)                         

In our case, the code/iframe tag looks like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Put your preferred title</title>
<style>

body{ background-color: purple;
background-text: white;}

</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>EMBEDDING A VIDEO</h1>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t4vKPhjcMZg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

</body>
</html>
```

**Step 6:** Open your HTML page.
Locate your HTML page, where you want to paste the iframe tag. 

**Step 7:** Type or paste the iframe tag into your HTML page that you copied from YouTube. Below is a sample of a simple HTML page used for demonstration.

**Step 8:** Save the changes you made on your HTML page. 
After saving, while you are still on your HTML page, right click and select ‚ÄúOpen in Browser‚Äù. By clicking on Open in Browser, your HMTL code will run in your browser.

**Step 9:** Your Browser‚Äôs output.
Depending on your HTML code(on how you have styled it), you can place the iframe tag anywhere you want within your HTML page. After you have successfully embedded a video in your webpage, you can actively interact with it meaning, you can fast forward and rewind it, play and pause, increase, and decrease the volume or even mute, click on YouTube icon in the embedded page to play the video directly on YouTube etc. All those activities are called video controls.

**Step 10:** Enjoy your view.
As mentioned earlier, CSS is basically for styling your webpage. Like the above screenshot contains a brown-ish/red-ish background and the screenshot below contains a purple background. You can play with the HTML and CSS skills to suit your preferences.

### Important Tips
- Avoid hyperlinked videos: The URL‚Äôs Video should be on its own without any characters or spaces before or after the URL and should not be a hyperlinked or it will not be embedded. What is hyperlink? is a highlight done to a link such that when it is clicked or hovered, the browser automatically displays another page or changes the current page to show the referenced content. 
- You can embed images and other contents as well into a post or page as long as the item you want to embed has its own URL.
- Due to copyrights, if the video you want to embed is not your own creation, it is prudent to ask permission from the owner.
